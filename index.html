      <p id="description">This website was created in accordance with the BHSEC Manhattan Language department to provide
        students in the Spanish program with a holistic practicing resource. The services offered are most recommended
        for students preparing for upcoming tests and quizzes, or for new Year 1 students who need a refresher on
        Spanish grammar and conjugations. This website was made entirely by George Crawford, a Year 1, with the
        assistance and guidance of Professor Curran.</p>
